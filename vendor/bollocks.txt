figure out if a board is valid we need to check:
- the current value is not repeated on the same row
- the current value is not repeated on the same column
- the current value is not repeated in the same quadrant

how to do we check which quadrant
- loop through the column
- everytime the column hits a multiple of three increase by 1

how to we check there is not repeatation on the same row:
- loop through the rows
- loop though the values in row excluding onces that are blank
- check that there isn't another instance of the value on the row
- if there is then we need to get the quadrant the value is in

how do we check there is no repeatation on the same column
- take the column using array_column
- loop through the values excluding empty ones

how do check there is no repeatation on the same quadrant
- count what row the number is on and increment by the quadrant by three everytime a multiple of 3 is counted
- once on the correct row then get the key in the individual array and count up by one everytime a multiple of three is counted
